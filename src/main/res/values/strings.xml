    <string name="welcome_body">behold, for this is your universe.\n\nyou can manipulate said universe by creating orbs (tap the screen) in one of four different modes (observe the button at the bottom of the screen).\n\nadditionally, you can adjust the cosmos\' properties by rotating your device. good use of kosm is down to experimentation.\n\nkosm, like most aural things, is best experienced with headphones...</string>

    <string name="hold_mode_body">tap and hold the screen at different lengths to create orbs.\n\nwhen you’re ready to start colliding particles, switch modes (to either default or emitter). the rest is down to experimenting.\n\nyou can always remove orbs by double tapping them.</string>

    <string name="three60_mode_body">tap the screen at a position of choice to create a circular container.\n\nuse pinch gestures to expand or collapse the size of the circle.\n\nrotating your device while creating particles can be either a very pleasing or unsettling experience.</string>
